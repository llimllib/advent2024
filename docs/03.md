# Day 3

## prelude

```js echo
import { inputDay } from "./lib/utilities.js"
```

The `munge` function I wrote in [01 - utilities](01_utilities) is not useful
for today, so I updated the `inputDay` function to accept a parser parameter
that lets us pass a parser to it.

## part 1

To pull out `mul(x,y)` statements, we can use a regular expression `mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)`. Thankfully, there aren't any spaces or negative numbers to deal with, so we can keep it simple.

Pull out each mul instruction, parse the arguments into numbers, multiply them, and sum the result.

```js echo
const test = `xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))`
const product = [...test.matchAll(/mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)/g)]
  .map(x => +x[1] * +x[2])
  .reduce((a, b) => a + b)
display(product)
```

That worked, so let's turn it into a function

```js echo
function parse(input) {
  return [...input.matchAll(/mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)/g)]
    .map(x => +x[1] * +x[2])
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b)
}
```

Which we can then use to parse the input

```js echo
display(await inputDay(3, { parser: parse }))
```

## part 2

Now we need to add `do\(\)` and `don\t\(\)` as options to our regular expression. If a result has matching groups, we know it's a multiply so parse it into numbers; otherwise just leave it in as is

```js echo
function parse2(input) {
  return [...input.matchAll(/mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)|do\(\)|don't\(\)/g)].map(x =>
    x[2] ? +x[1] * +x[2] : x[0],
  )
}
```

The result is a list whose contents are either a number, or a literal `do()` or `don't()`:

```js echo
display(await inputDay(3, { parser: parse2 }))
```

Go through the list and sum up the numbers when `active` is true

```js echo
const inp = await inputDay(3, { parser: parse2 })
let active = true
let sum = 0
for (const instr of inp) {
  if (active && typeof instr == "number") sum += instr
  if (active && instr == "don't()") active = false
  if (!active && instr == "do()") active = true
}
display(sum)
```

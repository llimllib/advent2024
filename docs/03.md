# Day 3

## prelude

```js echo
import { inputDay } from "./lib/utilities.js"
```

The `munge` function I wrote in [01 - utilities](01-utilities) is not useful
for today, so I updated the `inputDay` function to accept a parser parameter
that lets us pass a parser to it.

## part 1

To pull out `mul(x,y)` statements, we can use a regular expression `mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)`. Thankfully, there aren't any spaces or negative numbers to deal with, so we can keep it simple.

On the test input, pull out each mul instruction, parse the arguments into numbers, multiply them, and sum the result.

```js echo
const test = `xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))`
const product = test
  .matchAll(/mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)/g)
  .map(x => +x[1] * +x[2])
  .reduce((a, b) => a + b)
display(product)
```

To understand that code, it's important to know that `+` as a unary operator will convert a string to a number:

```js echo
display(+"12")
display(+"-42")
```

Our test code produced the correct result, so let's turn it into a function

```js echo
function parser(input) {
  return input
    .matchAll(/mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)/g)
    .map(x => +x[1] * +x[2])
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b)
}
```

Which we can then use to parse the input

```js echo
display(await inputDay(3, { parser }))
```

## part 2

Now we need to add `do\(\)` and `don\t\(\)` as options to our regular expression; we can use the alternation operator `|` and stick them on the end.

If the match has two groups, we'll multiply it as before; otherwise, just return the match.

```js echo
function parser2(input) {
  return input
    .matchAll(/mul\((\d+),(\d+)\)|do\(\)|don't\(\)/g)
    .toArray()
    .map(x => (x[2] ? +x[1] * +x[2] : x[0]))
}
```

The result is a list whose contents are either a number, or a literal `do()` or `don't()`:

```js echo
const inp = await inputDay(3, { parser: parser2 })
display(inp)
```

Go through the list and sum up the numbers when `active` is true

```js echo
let active = true
let sum = 0
for (const instr of inp) {
  if (active && typeof instr == "number") sum += instr
  if (active && instr == "don't()") active = false
  if (!active && instr == "do()") active = true
}
display(sum)
```
